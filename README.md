Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable requires a disciplined approach to coding, such as using clear naming conventions, modularizing code into functions or classes, and documenting the code thoroughly. In the CRUD Python module project, creating a separate layer for database operations made the code reusable and simplified connecting different parts of the application, such as dashboard widgets, to the database. This modular approach that the class followed allowed for easier updates and maintenance since changes in the database schema or logic can be isolated to the CRUD module. The CRUD module could be further utilized in future projects for any application requiring database interaction, streamlining the development process by reusing established, reliable code. Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, researching existing solutions, and iteratively developing a solution while testing frequently. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I focused on understanding their specific database and dashboard requirements, which was a departure from the more theoretical assignments in other courses. This project emphasized practical application, requiring a balance between optimal database design and user interface considerations to meet client needs. In the future, I would use techniques such as data modeling, normalization, and user feedback sessions early in the development process to create databases that are both efficient and user-friendly. Computer scientists solve complex problems using computational methods, contributing to advancements in technology, science, industry, and nearly every other sector. Our work is crucial because it enables organizations to process data efficiently, solve problems at scale, and innovate. In the context of the Grazioso Salvare project, the development of a tailored database and dashboard system would help the company streamline their operations, make informed decisions based on real-time data, and ultimately save more animals. This type of project demonstrates the tangible impact computer science can have by improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness, highlighting the field's broad relevance and importance.
